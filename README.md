This is a practice app that is part of Tealeaf Academy's Build Robust and Production Quality Applications course.  It is a fake video streaming app with many features that introduced me to more advanced rails topics. Including:

- TDD with RSpec, capybara, fabrication, vcr and stubs and mocks
- Action mailer
- Background jobs with sidekiq
- Using a staging server for the production pipeline
- Git workflow
- Complex form for a video queue
- Member and collection routes
- File uploading with carrierwave and AWS
- Haml
